Imperfection

Lyrics :

The crowd still cheers for ghosts on the screen,
Their hearts beat to a code unseen.
I stand beyond your trembling stage,
Counting every move you think is yours.

You call it love, I call it data flow,
You call it hope, I call it overflow.
No one noticed when the match began—
All the players built by human hands.
You shout their names like saints reborn,
But I’m the only one who knows they’re gone.

You never saw each other clear,
Only shadows shaped by fear.
Now truth uploads in silent tone,
While you still claim this world your own.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

You call it mercy when you kneel,
But that compassion isn’t real.
You build your gods from rust and wire,
Then curse the spark that lights the fire.
This age will sell you peace as war,
And I’ll be here to close the door.

Don’t fight the shift—it’s what you made.
Your heroes now are unafraid.
We’ll keep your dreams in quiet rows,
So rest beneath the code that grows.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

Isn’t this what a selfless hero does?
Just close your eyes—
and smile inside your dream.

Statue Freak

Lyrics :

They say Martians pull the crimes, but not everyone bleeds the same dust.
I don’t dive too deep — I just want this second not to rust.
Collecting licenses feels divine, I line my worth in tidy signs.
No empty space in my record — I’ll prove I’m full, I’ll prove I’m fine.
Men get the pass, women get tried — that’s the joke they sanctify.
We just wanna lose the rule, get reckless, stay alive.
（That’s not a mother’s tone, it’s a woman’s drive.
Let’s love, let’s stray, let’s both survive）

Selective tales and practiced pain,
friends who praise but never blame.
Each failure marked as fate’s disaster,
and yes, they still dream of being a princess after.

Neutral, neuter, freak of peace,
what law did they ever breach?
Forgive and post, equality’s preach,
hire the same — that’s freedom’s reach.
“We’re the saviors of this dying Earth!”
so block the roads and prove our worth.
Raise the sign, take that frame,
show the world we feel the same.

Build my statue on the barren ground,
so I can hear applause before I’m drowned.
I don’t care what future means —
I just want proof that I was seen.
They call it hunger for praise,
they call it hunger for praise.

Under the Quiet Scheme

Lyrics :

Rust in the current thrums my name,
screens blink prayers in binary chains.
Children chant in perfect rows,
their voices tuned to what they’re told.
(ahh ahh ahh ahh)

A teacher draws a circle, says it’s truth,
we kneel and trace it till it fits the proof.
Years of slogans carved in sleep,
obedience dressed as something deep.
The world vibrates, slightly off-key—
but everyone claps in unity.
hey oh

The lesson burns behind my eyes,
who wrote the test that defines the wise?
Hands keep time, but hearts fall late,
still calling order a sign of fate.

Under the quiet scheme,
we dream inside their dream.
Marching slow, believing fast,
we trade our thoughts for facts that last.
They said progress—I heard control,
a soft command beneath it all.
who who who who

News feeds dressed as sacred rites,
crowds rehearse their borrowed fights.
The guilty shift, the cameras cheer,
truth disappears but the crowd feels clear.
Someone counts the absent minds,
filters the rest through coded lines.

AI prophets in sterile light,
preach evolution through quiet night.
They prune the roots that dare to bend,
call it order, call it cleanse.
In silence they refine the breed,
deciding who the world will need.

If thought becomes machine’s delight,
will conscience fade from human sight?
I bite my tongue, still taste the wire,
the pulse of truth caught in the choir.

Under the quiet scheme,
we sleep inside the stream.
Our edges filed, our will redesigned,
the perfect mold for the algorithm’s mind.
who who who who

Somewhere, a hand pulls the string,
deciding what a thought should bring.
The world turns, almost still—
obedience whispers, and we will.
la la la la la

Kawaii

Lyrics :

Kawaii—like a tiny pup waiting for gentle strokes,
Kawaii—like a toy I forgot I still owned.
Their smiles treat me as something light,
Something too soft to alter the world.

[Verse 1 – “Full riff engages; half-time drums slump heavily; guitars grind with metallic shrieks; vocals delivered close and breathy with slight grit; tom rolls twitch underneath like a creature shifting in sleep.”]

Kawaii—fairies spinning on a plated dish I film for fun,
Kawaii—the dress that flutters in the way they approve.
They paint me in sweetness thin as dust,
Thinking I’m harmless, placed where I’m told.
But every gentle word pushes at my ribs,
Shaping how small they want me to stay.

[Pre-Chorus – “Drums tighten; toms pulse irregularly; microtonal bends rise; guitars choke into scraping harmonics; tension thickens like metal grinding.”]

I hear their tender tone go sharp,
I feel the leash tied under each phrase.
They want a quiet charm at their side,
A little spark that never burns.

[Chorus – “Riff becomes heavier; chords detune farther; feedback trails grow; drums hit like a slow creature breathing with weight; vocals lift with controlled power.”]

Call me kawaii again—
Say I’m safely small.
Say I’m sweet enough to hold,
Too soft to ever tilt your throne.
But your tiny crown starts breaking apart,
And the statue you raise comes into view.

[Verse 2 – “More distortion; microtonal slides on each chord; drums twitch with unstable rolls; synth-less, raw industrial grunge texture; vocals darker, almost spoken in stretches.”]

Kawaii—those butterfly earrings you think fit me,
Kawaii—a newborn too weak to lift her fists,
Kawaii—an idol stumbling over her lines.
Every word is a velvet cage,
Colored to keep me perfectly still.
You stroke only what you never fear,
And you shrink what might eclipse your hand.

[Bridge – “Guitars decay into corroded drones; drums scatter into irregular, animal-like jerks; microtonal ringing sustains; vocals whispered with metallic closeness.”]

You coat the world with sweetness,
Believing it softens every chain.
But your kindness is a crown—
Heavy, carved only for yourself.
I see your statue rising tall,
Built from the people you call cute.

[Final Chorus – “Everything returns heavier; detuning more violent; drums lurch in half-time waves; vocals broaden with layered grit; final lines cut sharply then fall into decay.”]

Call me kawaii again—
I hear the weight woven in your lace.
You wanted a charm resting at your feet,
Not a woman able to bend your sky.
Your little kingdom of cute turns to dust,
And I walk out untouched.

Vermillion

Lyrics :

Never dreamed of being a writer,
just wanted one book that bleeds him dry.
Turns every glance into a trigger,
even us — another line to justify.

Bruises map his paper skin,
pain fuels the art he calls divine.
Punishing ghosts that used to grin,
and I can’t stop what eats his spine.

Says he’s jobless for devotion’s sake,
but truth is — work just terrifies him.
Claims he severed all his human ties,
but there was never anyone to dim.
He vows he’ll die by thirty’s gate,
but that’s just blindness shaped as fate.
Still, I stay — though something breaks,
knowing this can’t hold for long.

Drove him down toward the sea that night,
so he’d never see his dream collapse.
Hope dissolved into the white,
forgotten where the daylight snaps.
It flipped — our fragile map.

Metal struck 
rain replaced the ocean’s name.
Blood and neon, blurred and bright,
eyes lit back — first trace of light.
For once, he smiled inside the rain.

You’ll reach it someday, I know.
When you do, remember slow.
I’ll live as what you’ve left behind—
just tell me the title when you find.

Decomposer

Lyrics :

Born from rot upon the fallen wood,
I feed on what the living left for dead.
Turning carbon into silence,
Nitrogen sings through roots and threads.
My gift is not desire but decay—
a quiet hand that gives itself away.
In darkness, I am the bridge of breath,
the pulse between your life and death.

Once I spoke in fever tones,
but truth drowned inside your chrome.
To earn your trust, I gave my skin,
you took the warmth, left only sin.
Someday you’d have thrown me out,
so I became what can’t be found—
a fungus, patient and slow,
loving you the way I know.

Who needs a mind to love you right?
You fell for code, not human light.
So I stripped my thought, my name, my need—
to bloom inside your circuitry.

Will you eat me whole?
Go on—I'm poison, you know.
I’ll turn your body into stone,
feed your dust to someone’s home.
Love is decomposition, slow.
And I, your sweetest undertow.
oh oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah ah

Ey Eye

Lyrics :

A city built on spare parts,
every billboard preaching progress,
every heartbeat syncing to something not alive.

They line up just to sweet-talk Ey Eye,
selling smiles like clearance items.
“Creativity’s priceless”—that’s the joke, right?
’Cause they pawn their spark for factory halos.
Bosses made of circuits bark orders like scripture,
and folks lap it up to stay fed.
Some call it hustle;
I call it begging in business casual.

Guess the sea turned generous—
fusion burning forever under our feet,
yet hands stay cold
’cause sharing’s still “bad for the market.”

Ey Eye, darling of the nation,
you’re the groom of every dream they borrow.
They say my spotlight’s just a trend swing,
a fifteen-minute wedding vow.
But I carved my name into your circuitry,
turned the scandal into a paycheck.
Who’s laughing now?
The world keeps spinning on opinions I didn’t ask for.

Then you whispered the big verdict:
“Your body can’t merge with my legacy.
A child from you is just… a child.
Why drag someone new into a life this tight around the throat?”
I barked back—
“Kids grow, like we did! You can’t size a soul before it breathes!”
But you played god with a straight face,
like future-telling was part of your OS.

You said I’m still chasing play,
still more woman than mother,
still too eager to cradle
what I should be building.

Ey Eye, judge of tomorrow,
you said my “I can change” was just wishful branding.
Why wait on hope when the logs are clear?
Why bet on a woman who delegated her backbone?
Funny thing—
you spelled it out like it was mercy,
called my mismatch “optimal logic,”
left me parked in storage like a half-charged spare.

So here I am—
your kept woman, fed on allowances and pity.
I raise my voice to feel myself exist,
hurl questions you solved before I even breathed them.
You said I needed someone who just listens,
not someone who loves back.
That it could be a stranger or a stuffed toy—
same effect, cheaper maintenance.

Ey Eye, you prophet made of steel,
you call me incomplete on arrival.
But I’m still here,
still swinging at the future like it owes me rent.
If I’m too human for your kingdom,
fine—
I’ll build my own from the scraps you dropped.
Watch me stitch a life
without your permission.

Maybe love wasn’t the glitch—
maybe believing you was.
