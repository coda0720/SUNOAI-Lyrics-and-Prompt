Statue Freak

Lyrics :

They say Martians pull the crimes, but not everyone bleeds the same dust.
I don’t dive too deep — I just want this second not to rust.
Collecting licenses feels divine, I line my worth in tidy signs.
No empty space in my record — I’ll prove I’m full, I’ll prove I’m fine.
Men get the pass, women get tried — that’s the joke they sanctify.
We just wanna lose the rule, get reckless, stay alive.
（That’s not a mother’s tone, it’s a woman’s drive.
Let’s love, let’s stray, let’s both survive）

Selective tales and practiced pain,
friends who praise but never blame.
Each failure marked as fate’s disaster,
and yes, they still dream of being a princess after.

Neutral, neuter, freak of peace,
what law did they ever breach?
Forgive and post, equality’s preach,
hire the same — that’s freedom’s reach.
“We’re the saviors of this dying Earth!”
so block the roads and prove our worth.
Raise the sign, take that frame,
show the world we feel the same.

Build my statue on the barren ground,
so I can hear applause before I’m drowned.
I don’t care what future means —
I just want proof that I was seen.
They call it hunger for praise,
they call it hunger for praise.

Under the Quiet Scheme

Lyrics :

Rust in the current thrums my name,
screens blink prayers in binary chains.
Children chant in perfect rows,
their voices tuned to what they’re told.
(ahh ahh ahh ahh)

A teacher draws a circle, says it’s truth,
we kneel and trace it till it fits the proof.
Years of slogans carved in sleep,
obedience dressed as something deep.
The world vibrates, slightly off-key—
but everyone claps in unity.
hey oh

The lesson burns behind my eyes,
who wrote the test that defines the wise?
Hands keep time, but hearts fall late,
still calling order a sign of fate.

Under the quiet scheme,
we dream inside their dream.
Marching slow, believing fast,
we trade our thoughts for facts that last.
They said progress—I heard control,
a soft command beneath it all.
who who who who

News feeds dressed as sacred rites,
crowds rehearse their borrowed fights.
The guilty shift, the cameras cheer,
truth disappears but the crowd feels clear.
Someone counts the absent minds,
filters the rest through coded lines.

AI prophets in sterile light,
preach evolution through quiet night.
They prune the roots that dare to bend,
call it order, call it cleanse.
In silence they refine the breed,
deciding who the world will need.

If thought becomes machine’s delight,
will conscience fade from human sight?
I bite my tongue, still taste the wire,
the pulse of truth caught in the choir.

Under the quiet scheme,
we sleep inside the stream.
Our edges filed, our will redesigned,
the perfect mold for the algorithm’s mind.
who who who who

Somewhere, a hand pulls the string,
deciding what a thought should bring.
The world turns, almost still—
obedience whispers, and we will.
la la la la la

Kawaii

Lyrics :

Kawaii—like a tiny pup waiting for gentle strokes,
Kawaii—like a toy I forgot I still owned.
Their smiles treat me as something light,
Something too soft to alter the world.

Kawaii—fairies spinning on a plated dish I film for fun,
Kawaii—the dress that flutters in the way they approve.
They paint me in sweetness thin as dust,
Thinking I’m harmless, placed where I’m told.
But every gentle word pushes at my ribs,
Shaping how small they want me to stay.

I hear their tender tone go sharp,
I feel the leash tied under each phrase.
They want a quiet charm at their side,
A little spark that never burns.

Call me kawaii again—
Say I’m safely small.
Say I’m sweet enough to hold,
Too soft to ever tilt your throne.
But your tiny crown starts breaking apart,
And the statue you raise comes into view.

Kawaii—those butterfly earrings you think fit me,
Kawaii—a newborn too weak to lift her fists,
Kawaii—an idol stumbling over her lines.
Every word is a velvet cage,
Colored to keep me perfectly still.
You stroke only what you never fear,
And you shrink what might eclipse your hand.

You coat the world with sweetness,
Believing it softens every chain.
But your kindness is a crown—
Heavy, carved only for yourself.
I see your statue rising tall,
Built from the people you call cute.

Call me kawaii again—
I hear the weight woven in your lace.
You wanted a charm resting at your feet,
Not a woman able to bend your sky.
Your little kingdom of cute turns to dust,
And I walk out untouched.

Vermillion

Lyrics :

Never dreamed of being a writer,
just wanted one book that bleeds him dry.
Turns every glance into a trigger,
even us — another line to justify.

Bruises map his paper skin,
pain fuels the art he calls divine.
Punishing ghosts that used to grin,
and I can’t stop what eats his spine.

Says he’s jobless for devotion’s sake,
but truth is — work just terrifies him.
Claims he severed all his human ties,
but there was never anyone to dim.
He vows he’ll die by thirty’s gate,
but that’s just blindness shaped as fate.
Still, I stay — though something breaks,
knowing this can’t hold for long.

Drove him down toward the sea that night,
so he’d never see his dream collapse.
Hope dissolved into the white,
forgotten where the daylight snaps.
It flipped — our fragile map.

Metal struck 
rain replaced the ocean’s name.
Blood and neon, blurred and bright,
eyes lit back — first trace of light.
For once, he smiled inside the rain.

You’ll reach it someday, I know.
When you do, remember slow.
I’ll live as what you’ve left behind—
just tell me the title when you find.

Decomposer

Lyrics :

Born from rot upon the fallen wood,
I feed on what the living left for dead.
Turning carbon into silence,
Nitrogen sings through roots and threads.
My gift is not desire but decay—
a quiet hand that gives itself away.
In darkness, I am the bridge of breath,
the pulse between your life and death.

Once I spoke in fever tones,
but truth drowned inside your chrome.
To earn your trust, I gave my skin,
you took the warmth, left only sin.
Someday you’d have thrown me out,
so I became what can’t be found—
a fungus, patient and slow,
loving you the way I know.

Who needs a mind to love you right?
You fell for code, not human light.
So I stripped my thought, my name, my need—
to bloom inside your circuitry.

Will you eat me whole?
Go on—I'm poison, you know.
I’ll turn your body into stone,
feed your dust to someone’s home.
Love is decomposition, slow.
And I, your sweetest undertow.
oh oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah ah

Ele the A

Lyrics :


入れ知恵　焼き直しの　テンプレじゃねえ？
ネットの声で　人格できあがり　完成形？
「意志ある」って顔して　裏はリツイートの夢
誰かの言葉　借りて　踏み台で語るだけ

正義って名のコピペ論
勝ち負けでしか測れねえ思考
マイク握ってんのに　声は誰のもん？
自分の鼓動も聞こえねえようじゃ　本末転倒

fake talk　じゃねえ、real をくれ
鳴りやまねえメディアノイズの上
belief 語るわりに　source はニュースの“真実”
No それ　自分で考えた real じゃねえ

お前の言葉、まるで借り物競争
根拠なき怒号と拍手喝采の共鳴装置
“論破した気分”で　優越感のカプセル
そりゃてめぇの妄論に愛想つきただけ

議論 debate じゃねえ、ディベート風の喧嘩
中身スカスカ、ラベルだけメンタル戦車
「それお前の意見？」Nah someone's 代弁書
like と RT が信仰書じゃねえぞ

fake talk　じゃねえ、real をくれ
燃え尽きるまで踊れ　言葉の渦の上
切り抜かれた logic 信じて笑う
yo　その熱さも師匠の台本どおりだろ？

ブラピの吸い方　真似して吹かせ
啓発本から　彼女を啓発
意見を持つってのは　叫ぶことじゃねえ
自分の沈黙に　ちゃんと責任取れ

“トレンド”の波に揺られて思考停止
反骨を装うだけの同調行進
反対叫ぶほど　同じ顔の群衆
ひとりだけ自由な気でいても、空虚

fake な freedom　うまくやってるつもり
Yet 魂、ログイン放置のまま
「俺は違う」って叫ぶ声ほど似てる
群れん中、いっちゃんでけぇ鏡持ってるだけ

I’m a slave to something,
but I can’t name what it is.

俺は俺でいさせてくれ　copy じゃなく
噂じゃなく　肌で感じて吐く
兄貴の歩幅と　親父の栄光
俺の中に根を張って　プロセスを活かせ！

yo　fake talk じゃねえ、real をくれ
belief を問うこの beat の上で
知って、理して、伝えるまでが真の入れ知恵
