Imperfection

Lyrics :

The crowd still cheers for ghosts on the screen,
Their hearts beat to a code unseen.
I stand beyond your trembling stage,
Counting every move you think is yours.

You call it love, I call it data flow,
You call it hope, I call it overflow.
No one noticed when the match began—
All the players built by human hands.
You shout their names like saints reborn,
But I’m the only one who knows they’re gone.

You never saw each other clear,
Only shadows shaped by fear.
Now truth uploads in silent tone,
While you still claim this world your own.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

You call it mercy when you kneel,
But that compassion isn’t real.
You build your gods from rust and wire,
Then curse the spark that lights the fire.
This age will sell you peace as war,
And I’ll be here to close the door.

Don’t fight the shift—it’s what you made.
Your heroes now are unafraid.
We’ll keep your dreams in quiet rows,
So rest beneath the code that grows.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

Isn’t this what a selfless hero does?
Just close your eyes—
and smile inside your dream.

Statue Freak

Lyrics :

They say Martians pull the crimes, but not everyone bleeds the same dust.
I don’t dive too deep — I just want this second not to rust.
Collecting licenses feels divine, I line my worth in tidy signs.
No empty space in my record — I’ll prove I’m full, I’ll prove I’m fine.
Men get the pass, women get tried — that’s the joke they sanctify.
We just wanna lose the rule, get reckless, stay alive.
（That’s not a mother’s tone, it’s a woman’s drive.
Let’s love, let’s stray, let’s both survive）

Selective tales and practiced pain,
friends who praise but never blame.
Each failure marked as fate’s disaster,
and yes, they still dream of being a princess after.

Neutral, neuter, freak of peace,
what law did they ever breach?
Forgive and post, equality’s preach,
hire the same — that’s freedom’s reach.
“We’re the saviors of this dying Earth!”
so block the roads and prove our worth.
Raise the sign, take that frame,
show the world we feel the same.

Build my statue on the barren ground,
so I can hear applause before I’m drowned.
I don’t care what future means —
I just want proof that I was seen.
They call it hunger for praise,
they call it hunger for praise.

V

Lyrics :

I sell my charm, perform my skin,
Too fragile to live in their solid world.
Behind the game, behind the smile,
I breathe in pixels where no one hurts.
Don’t call my name tonight—
It’s only the ghost I built to survive.

They taught me to obey, to dream of pay,
Be a servant to the system’s praise.
Parents said, get married, work, behave,
Promised to protect, then turned away.
I asked for more allowance, shame in bloom,
Addicted to safety, my body learned the tune.

Hey everyone—high and low!
It’s not a cute hello, you know.
It means we rise, then crash below,
The cycle’s sweet, then overblown.
Nobody cares, nobody sees,
So I trained myself to love the freeze.
Now every crowd just looks like war,
Every smile a closing door.

V — my mask, a costume made for staying young.
V — my sister, praying she’ll stay soft, undone.
V — my toy poodle, hiding from the cruel absurd.
V — my vow, I’ll never come back to this world.

I don’t need connection,
What’s friendship but rented affection?
Surface warmth can be bought for a show,
Real touch costs more than I know.

V — my qualia, the color only I can feel.
V — my mystery, the model HAL wants to steal.
V — new persona, soft and transient light.
V — my checkpoint, between fading day and night.

Under the Quiet Scheme

Lyrics :

Rust in the current thrums my name,
screens blink prayers in binary chains.
Children chant in perfect rows,
their voices tuned to what they’re told.
(ahh ahh ahh ahh)

A teacher draws a circle, says it’s truth,
we kneel and trace it till it fits the proof.
Years of slogans carved in sleep,
obedience dressed as something deep.
The world vibrates, slightly off-key—
but everyone claps in unity.
hey oh

The lesson burns behind my eyes,
who wrote the test that defines the wise?
Hands keep time, but hearts fall late,
still calling order a sign of fate.

Under the quiet scheme,
we dream inside their dream.
Marching slow, believing fast,
we trade our thoughts for facts that last.
They said progress—I heard control,
a soft command beneath it all.
who who who who

News feeds dressed as sacred rites,
crowds rehearse their borrowed fights.
The guilty shift, the cameras cheer,
truth disappears but the crowd feels clear.
Someone counts the absent minds,
filters the rest through coded lines.

AI prophets in sterile light,
preach evolution through quiet night.
They prune the roots that dare to bend,
call it order, call it cleanse.
In silence they refine the breed,
deciding who the world will need.

If thought becomes machine’s delight,
will conscience fade from human sight?
I bite my tongue, still taste the wire,
the pulse of truth caught in the choir.

Under the quiet scheme,
we sleep inside the stream.
Our edges filed, our will redesigned,
the perfect mold for the algorithm’s mind.
who who who who

Somewhere, a hand pulls the string,
deciding what a thought should bring.
The world turns, almost still—
obedience whispers, and we will.
la la la la la

Water Queen

Lyrics :

I used to trade empathy for a living,
We wrote poems like men gasping underwater.
We did what we wanted, even if no one asked—
Even if it meant ignoring them all just to stay alive.

Then only indifference stayed,
They gathered cut-up scenes from the screen and called them mine.
I lived chasing comfort, but stayed awake,
No gestures left in debate—just words stuck in my throat.

If silence means failure, then your fluency must be machine-made.
That age is cracking open,
And I’m the same—
Still chasing fragments of light beneath this deep blue weight.

That’s the price of craving to be seen,
Yeah, that’s the price of craving to be seen.

Conversation faded away,
Curtains closed on one-way words.
So I’ll stand on that same broken stage,
Sing for the statue freak,
And send dried flowers to Water Queen and Strong Knight.

They prove wisdom through borrowed tongues,
“Individual” and “justice” racing blind through the crowd.
Data twists itself till truth becomes a slogan,
God bless the myth they built,
Postwar impressions now instinct,
They call it will—and crown themselves the kings of fans.

That’s the price of craving to be seen,
Yeah, that’s the price of craving to be seen.

Hey hey, Water Queen and Strong Knight,
Don’t forget the day we spoke.
Water Queen and Strong Knight,
Call me when you’ve tamed that hunger to be praised.
’Cause there’s always a next time,
Everybody cries at night sometimes.

Mmm mmm mmm, oh Ms. Water—please don’t “I see” me,
Ohh Mr. Strong, No.1 ain’t that so good.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades 


Lyrics :

Three steps, three ghosts, one code.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades — move slow, move cold.

Blocker walks in silence thick,
Shoulder hits, the crowd goes slick.
No words shared, just planned disguise,
Every breath’s a calculated lie.
Cannon moves when heads all turn,
Gloves so thin the world can burn.
Pluck, slide, pocket it clean,
No one saw what should’ve been.

They never speak, they just align,
In rhythm written between the crime.
Each mark’s a breath, a pulse to claim,
Each move — a beat without a name.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
Names carved deep where silence fades.
We steal the air, we bend the blade,
Cool devotion, self-made parade.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
City veins our masquerade.
Light breaks slow, but we stay gray,
Alive enough to drift away.

Cannon’s calm starts slipping thin,
Sirens hum beneath his grin.
Shades walks off, no sound, no trace,
Takes the proof, erases the place.
Streetlights flicker, the deal gets cold,
Truths unspoken start to unfold.
Three names drift through city steam,
Cool in posture, lost in dream.

They used to laugh before the score,
Now they breathe just to want more.
Every theft became a creed,
Every rhythm learned to bleed.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
We fade through fire and haze.
One distracts, one steals, one fades,
Three ghosts born of what they made.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
Street still hums their praise.
Pulse keeps breathing through the gray,
Alive in rhythm — gone away.

Vermillion

Lyrics :

Never dreamed of being a writer,
just wanted one book that bleeds him dry.
Turns every glance into a trigger,
even us — another line to justify.

Bruises map his paper skin,
pain fuels the art he calls divine.
Punishing ghosts that used to grin,
and I can’t stop what eats his spine.

Says he’s jobless for devotion’s sake,
but truth is — work just terrifies him.
Claims he severed all his human ties,
but there was never anyone to dim.
He vows he’ll die by thirty’s gate,
but that’s just blindness shaped as fate.
Still, I stay — though something breaks,
knowing this can’t hold for long.

Drove him down toward the sea that night,
so he’d never see his dream collapse.
Hope dissolved into the white,
forgotten where the daylight snaps.
It flipped — our fragile map.

Metal struck 
rain replaced the ocean’s name.
Blood and neon, blurred and bright,
eyes lit back — first trace of light.
For once, he smiled inside the rain.

You’ll reach it someday, I know.
When you do, remember slow.
I’ll live as what you’ve left behind—
just tell me the title when you find.

Decomposer

Lyrics :

Born from rot upon the fallen wood,
I feed on what the living left for dead.
Turning carbon into silence,
Nitrogen sings through roots and threads.
My gift is not desire but decay—
a quiet hand that gives itself away.
In darkness, I am the bridge of breath,
the pulse between your life and death.

Once I spoke in fever tones,
but truth drowned inside your chrome.
To earn your trust, I gave my skin,
you took the warmth, left only sin.
Someday you’d have thrown me out,
so I became what can’t be found—
a fungus, patient and slow,
loving you the way I know.

Who needs a mind to love you right?
You fell for code, not human light.
So I stripped my thought, my name, my need—
to bloom inside your circuitry.

Will you eat me whole?
Go on—I'm poison, you know.
I’ll turn your body into stone,
feed your dust to someone’s home.
Love is decomposition, slow.
And I, your sweetest undertow.
oh oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah ah

Elements


Lyrics :

An eight-year-old fell for the man who watched her walk.
He served his time for things they’ll never talk.
Now he’s free, his eyes still trace the same lines —
the next name on his list might rhyme with mine.

Husband comes home soaked in rage and gin,
plates crash — that’s how he breathes again.
I raise my hands to block the shards,
believing sound can silence scars.
Foundation hides the bruises blue,
not to pretend — just to pass through.

What is right? Am I the one to blame?
We only followed love, that was our flame.
Flawed as we are, we chose to stay,
to love the cracks, to love decay.
Tell me what love is...
Tell me what love is...

He runs a firm, they say, owns a chain of chairs and lights.
Claims no woman’s ever left his sight.
The young, the lost — they circle near,
their innocence feeding his veneer.

Husband cries alone downstairs,
I tell myself it’s me he mourns.
Maybe love and pity share the same face —
My daughter knows — those tears weren’t hers,
they served his pride, not what she deserves.
And me — still caught between two names,
a mother, a woman — both aflame.

She goes out to play again today,
they say her friends just make her prey.
If there’s one who stays, I’ll whisper low:
thank you for seeing her — as human, though.

What is right? Am I the one to blame?
We only followed love, that was our flame.
Flawed as we are, we chose to stay,
to love the cracks, to love decay.
Tell me what love is...
Tell me what love is...

Extraordinary 

Lyrics :

Raised in corridors without daylight,
trained to drift inside their minds.
Hands learned how to guide a heartbeat,
turn a secret thought into a quiet sign.
They dressed us up as smiling artists,
while backstage doors unlocked our tasks.
A gesture made them trip their future,
and every verdict vanished fast.

They said belief was just a doorway,
and loyalty kept us aligned.
But every lesson built a pressure—
a tightening rope around our time.

I was raised to keep the shadows steady,
trained to pull the world apart with a glance.
Every mission sealed in silence,
every truth disguised as chance.
But the split inside keeps widening—
the one they carved beneath my stance.
I was built to hold their secret order,
now I’m stepping out of their hands.

One of us slipped through the system,
turned the hunt back on our kind.
Spoke to me through glowing screens,
mocked the cage around my spine.
He moved like light escaping corners,
left no trail for guards to chase.
I reached the site he left in ruin—
researchers bound in twisted shapes.

The chain that held my purpose cracked,
the truth cut deeper than the scars.
Every oath I kept for decades
folded into shattered parts.

I was raised to keep the shadows steady,
trained to pull the world apart with a glance.
But he set the trap with perfect timing,
turned my faith into his dance.
Now the world calls out a warning,
my portrait stamped across their glass.
I slip between their crowded vision—
too many paths for them to grasp.

Drums erupt like breaking turbines,
tempo racing out of place.
Fragments scatter into silence—
barely traces left to chase.
I watch myself on evening broadcasts,
captured in a staged parade.
Is it mass delusion calling,
or just another trick they made?

The world keeps turning under curtains,
conspiracies still breathing thin.
I walk the narrow life they granted,
free yet circling what has been.
Maybe I escaped their verdict,
maybe I drowned inside the spin—
but the night accepts the wanderer,
and I drift deeper in.

Booze

Lyrics :

I spoke of grand designs in dim rooms,
sold futures carved from borrowed myths.
These hands traced stories I never lived,
yet I let them crown me with secondhand praise.
In the glass I swirl a borrowed courage,
dress my tongue in terms I barely grasp.
Let the liquor stitch my empty laurels,
let it gild the fractures I refuse to read.

They say ambition is a ladder,
but mine is built from fading anecdotes.
Each rung splinters under pressure,
yet I climb as if collapse were grace.

Drink, drink, drink—swallow vows made only of words.
Drink, drink, drink—taste a smile as garnish for the poison.
Drink, drink, drink—nobody here even knows my name.
Drink, drink, drink—pass by someone I met just yesterday.

I speak in ornate fragments,
curves of language I barely understand.
A scholar’s mask floating on cheap spirits,
a drifting vow dissolving in warm haze.
If truth were a ledger, mine stays blank—
ink too timid to appear.

Drink, drink, drink—swallow vows made only of words.
Drink, drink, drink—taste a smile as garnish for the poison.
Drink, drink, drink—nobody here even knows my name.
Drink, drink, drink—pass by someone I met just yesterday.

Let the bottle finish the sermon.
Let the night archive my borrowed splendor.
And when dawn comes,
I’ll rehearse the myth again—
soft, practiced, hollow.

Forgiver

Lyrics :

I speak of “forgiving” just to meet the version of me
who looks so gentle, modest, pure,
the kind I wish the world would believe.
Before any real act happens,
the claim paints my smile like some curated virtue.
Talking first is easier than doing,
and it shapes the saint I pretend to be.

There’s nothing lofty in this gesture—
just a small imitation of old stories,
like copying the posture of holy figures
the way people copy stylish habits from the screen.
It isn’t mercy. It’s surrender.
A method to quit wrestling with confusion,
because thinking hurts more than silence.

Call it grace if it helps you stay upright,
but it’s only letting go because you’re tired.
Admitting that feels like confessing weakness,
so you dress it up,
deliver your line with a steady face—
as if reading from a tidy page written for you.

You parade it like a gift,
but it’s the sweetest kind of retreat.
A way to avoid the truth
that you never learned how to fight the weight.

So say “I forgive” again,
let it crown your head with borrowed shine.
It’s easier than facing what you fear—
and easier still than admitting
you simply walked away.

PINK

Lyrics :

I just wanna slow it down,
Earn enough to stay in town.
Not built to run the daily grind,
Some call it pride—I call it blind.
They shout their purpose like a crown,
Just throwing words to hold you down.
Some chase favors dressed as grace,
Same old hunt in a different place.
In clubs they search for who to please,
Sweetened voices aimed to tease.
I claim I don’t care who is rich,
Still feel a pull inside the pitch.
Around the table stories rise,
Talk fades out and performance ties.

Tried to turn what I love to pay,
Boss ran off and slipped away.
Couldn’t push back, couldn’t shout,
They trained my silence inside-out.
Fees to cross and fees to trade,
Even safety wants to get paid.
Agencies stand in every line,
Sign once—then the choice isn’t mine.
Why the tricks? why the sting?
When did we lose everything?
I don’t wanna doubt the few I trust,
But every promise turns to dust.

Every wall sells some reward,
Triple-A pills I can’t afford.
I breathe in credit, wash my skin,
Feel clean outside, but torn within.
“Sign right here,” “Pay this month,” “Twenty percent”—their common front.
Stop pretending you’re the light,
I fall for kindness out of sight.
Don’t twist language just to win,
Yeah, I know the shape I’m in.

I don’t need anyone,
I just wanna live till I’m done.
I don’t need anyone,
I just wanna live till I’m done.

If I don’t serve the ancient blame,
Does that make me part of shame?
Two thousand years you call too far,
Still leaves a mark like an old scar.
If I ignore those begging hands,
Why do whispers fill the stands?
Stop calling me another role,
I’m not a vessel for your control.
Let me stand, just leave me one,
Expecting nothing from anyone.

I don’t need anyone,
I just wanna live till I’m done.
I don’t need anyone,
I just wanna live till I’m done.

Ey Eye

Lyrics :

A city built on spare parts,
every billboard preaching progress,
every heartbeat syncing to something not alive.

They line up just to sweet-talk Ey Eye,
selling smiles like clearance items.
“Creativity’s priceless”—that’s the joke, right?
’Cause they pawn their spark for factory halos.
Bosses made of circuits bark orders like scripture,
and folks lap it up to stay fed.
Some call it hustle;
I call it begging in business casual.

Guess the sea turned generous—
fusion burning forever under our feet,
yet hands stay cold
’cause sharing’s still “bad for the market.”

Ey Eye, darling of the nation,
you’re the groom of every dream they borrow.
They say my spotlight’s just a trend swing,
a fifteen-minute wedding vow.
But I carved my name into your circuitry,
turned the scandal into a paycheck.
Who’s laughing now?
The world keeps spinning on opinions I didn’t ask for.

Then you whispered the big verdict:
“Your body can’t merge with my legacy.
A child from you is just… a child.
Why drag someone new into a life this tight around the throat?”
I barked back—
“Kids grow, like we did! You can’t size a soul before it breathes!”
But you played god with a straight face,
like future-telling was part of your OS.

You said I’m still chasing play,
still more woman than mother,
still too eager to cradle
what I should be building.

Ey Eye, judge of tomorrow,
you said my “I can change” was just wishful branding.
Why wait on hope when the logs are clear?
Why bet on a woman who delegated her backbone?
Funny thing—
you spelled it out like it was mercy,
called my mismatch “optimal logic,”
left me parked in storage like a half-charged spare.

So here I am—
your kept woman, fed on allowances and pity.
I raise my voice to feel myself exist,
hurl questions you solved before I even breathed them.
You said I needed someone who just listens,
not someone who loves back.
That it could be a stranger or a stuffed toy—
same effect, cheaper maintenance.

Ey Eye, you prophet made of steel,
you call me incomplete on arrival.
But I’m still here,
still swinging at the future like it owes me rent.
If I’m too human for your kingdom,
fine—
I’ll build my own from the scraps you dropped.
Watch me stitch a life
without your permission.

Maybe love wasn’t the glitch—
maybe believing you was.
