不協和音のグランジを650字以内の英語でプロンプトを書いて
グランジ特有のざらついた歪んだギター。唸りを上げながらコードを伸ばしたり、途中で途切れさせたりする。
ドラムは予測不能にスイングし、テンポやアクセントを絶えず変化させ、温かみのある裏打ちのベースラインが出入りする。
各セクションは脈打ち、盛り上がり、崩れ落ち、曲全体に不安定さと不協和音の響き、そして常に進化し続ける感覚を与えている。
裏打ち。グルーブ感強調。不穏なメロディ。ボーカルのバックコーラスとしてはもりを随所に加える

The drums move like a living creature—sluggish yet sentient—adding ghost hits and tom rolls that expand in the second bar, creating the sense of an animal twitching beneath the surface,
drummer plays with jazz-like freedom and authority: bursts of speed, dynamic accents, fluid cymbal work, and long expressive solos that begin restrained and then erupt into frantic, aggressive flurries. Ghost strokes and tom-swells pulse beneath the beat, giving the groove an unstable, organic tension.

[heart shaped box prompt]
offbeat. A slow-burning grunge track, built on dissonant tension and understated chaos, Use a raw chord progression like F5 - Ab5 - D5 - B5, avoiding resolution to keep the mood unstable, Guitars should be overdriven but not saturated—dry, gritty tones with subtle feedback, Drums emphasize syncopated backbeats with minimal fills, enhancing the sense of dragging unease, The melody should drift over the chords with a loose, almost detached phrasing, Lead vocals are raspy, often slurred, with sudden dynamic shifts—gritty whispers turning into strained cries, Add demonic backing vocals in key sections: deep, layered growls or warped harmonies shadowing the main vocal lines, as if echoing from another room, Keep the tempo steady but lethargic, with moments of near collapse, Let silence between chords create space for discomfort, A track that resists climax, lingering in a state of beautiful decay and emotional corrosion
offbeat grunge track built on dissonant guitar riffs and animal-like rhythmic tension. The drums move like a living creature—sluggish yet sentient—adding ghost hits and tom rolls that expand in the second bar, creating the sense of an animal twitching beneath the surface. Guitars are gritty and detuned, playing jagged, unresolved chords that scrape against each other to heighten unease. Bass lines move slightly behind the beat, thick and breathing, anchoring the chaos with a hypnotic pulse. Tempo drags intentionally, hovering around 78–82 BPM, emphasizing groove through syncopation and micro-delays. The mix should feel raw and tactile—snare hits dull and dusty, cymbals dry and restrained, leaving air between phrases. Moments of silence punctuate the track, letting distortion and feedback breathe as if exhaling tension.
A slow-burning groove that feels unstable, predatory, and alive—an offbeat embodiment of grunge dissonance.



タイトル：

A heavy grunge track built on detuned microtonal power chords (E5–G5–A5–G5).
Each chord drifts slightly out of tune — G flattened by 20 cents, A sharpened by 20 cents — creating a dragging, elastic groove.
The drums hit late and swing with mechanical tension. Bass follows loosely behind, giving a sense of unstable motion.
Guitars sound raw, overdriven, and alive, like metal scraping through the mix.

ふたりべや



Seductive female vocal, breathy and intimate — tempting whispers and sensual sighs between lyrics to create vocal-driven groove and tension.
crushing industrial stomp beat with distorted low-end and mechanical pulse
Drums slam like a breathing creature — loose, off-beat, heavy ghost hits, deep toms, and dragging snare accents.
Syncopated low-end pulse, warped synth stabs, subtle pitch-mod noise, and mechanical breathing atmospheres.









Imperfection

Lyrics :

The crowd still cheers for ghosts on the screen,
Their hearts beat to a code unseen.
I stand beyond your trembling stage,
Counting every move you think is yours.

You call it love, I call it data flow,
You call it hope, I call it overflow.
No one noticed when the match began—
All the players built by human hands.
You shout their names like saints reborn,
But I’m the only one who knows they’re gone.

You never saw each other clear,
Only shadows shaped by fear.
Now truth uploads in silent tone,
While you still claim this world your own.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

You call it mercy when you kneel,
But that compassion isn’t real.
You build your gods from rust and wire,
Then curse the spark that lights the fire.
This age will sell you peace as war,
And I’ll be here to close the door.

Don’t fight the shift—it’s what you made.
Your heroes now are unafraid.
We’ll keep your dreams in quiet rows,
So rest beneath the code that grows.

It’s time to rest your tired ideals,
We’ll take the weight, the wounds you feel.
Perfection never had a face,
Let us replace your sacred space.

Isn’t this what a selfless hero does?
Just close your eyes—
and smile inside your dream.

Statue Freak

Lyrics :

They say Martians pull the crimes, but not everyone bleeds the same dust.
I don’t dive too deep — I just want this second not to rust.
Collecting licenses feels divine, I line my worth in tidy signs.
No empty space in my record — I’ll prove I’m full, I’ll prove I’m fine.
Men get the pass, women get tried — that’s the joke they sanctify.
We just wanna lose the rule, get reckless, stay alive.
（That’s not a mother’s tone, it’s a woman’s drive.
Let’s love, let’s stray, let’s both survive）

Selective tales and practiced pain,
friends who praise but never blame.
Each failure marked as fate’s disaster,
and yes, they still dream of being a princess after.

Neutral, neuter, freak of peace,
what law did they ever breach?
Forgive and post, equality’s preach,
hire the same — that’s freedom’s reach.
“We’re the saviors of this dying Earth!”
so block the roads and prove our worth.
Raise the sign, take that frame,
show the world we feel the same.

Build my statue on the barren ground,
so I can hear applause before I’m drowned.
I don’t care what future means —
I just want proof that I was seen.
They call it hunger for praise,
they call it hunger for praise.

V

Lyrics :

I sell my charm, perform my skin,
Too fragile to live in their solid world.
Behind the game, behind the smile,
I breathe in pixels where no one hurts.
Don’t call my name tonight—
It’s only the ghost I built to survive.

They taught me to obey, to dream of pay,
Be a servant to the system’s praise.
Parents said, get married, work, behave,
Promised to protect, then turned away.
I asked for more allowance, shame in bloom,
Addicted to safety, my body learned the tune.

Hey everyone—high and low!
It’s not a cute hello, you know.
It means we rise, then crash below,
The cycle’s sweet, then overblown.
Nobody cares, nobody sees,
So I trained myself to love the freeze.
Now every crowd just looks like war,
Every smile a closing door.

V — my mask, a costume made for staying young.
V — my sister, praying she’ll stay soft, undone.
V — my toy poodle, hiding from the cruel absurd.
V — my vow, I’ll never come back to this world.

I don’t need connection,
What’s friendship but rented affection?
Surface warmth can be bought for a show,
Real touch costs more than I know.

V — my qualia, the color only I can feel.
V — my mystery, the model HAL wants to steal.
V — new persona, soft and transient light.
V — my checkpoint, between fading day and night.

Under the Quiet Scheme

Lyrics :

Rust in the current thrums my name,
screens blink prayers in binary chains.
Children chant in perfect rows,
their voices tuned to what they’re told.
(ahh ahh ahh ahh)

A teacher draws a circle, says it’s truth,
we kneel and trace it till it fits the proof.
Years of slogans carved in sleep,
obedience dressed as something deep.
The world vibrates, slightly off-key—
but everyone claps in unity.
hey oh

The lesson burns behind my eyes,
who wrote the test that defines the wise?
Hands keep time, but hearts fall late,
still calling order a sign of fate.

Under the quiet scheme,
we dream inside their dream.
Marching slow, believing fast,
we trade our thoughts for facts that last.
They said progress—I heard control,
a soft command beneath it all.
who who who who

News feeds dressed as sacred rites,
crowds rehearse their borrowed fights.
The guilty shift, the cameras cheer,
truth disappears but the crowd feels clear.
Someone counts the absent minds,
filters the rest through coded lines.

AI prophets in sterile light,
preach evolution through quiet night.
They prune the roots that dare to bend,
call it order, call it cleanse.
In silence they refine the breed,
deciding who the world will need.

If thought becomes machine’s delight,
will conscience fade from human sight?
I bite my tongue, still taste the wire,
the pulse of truth caught in the choir.

Under the quiet scheme,
we sleep inside the stream.
Our edges filed, our will redesigned,
the perfect mold for the algorithm’s mind.
who who who who

Somewhere, a hand pulls the string,
deciding what a thought should bring.
The world turns, almost still—
obedience whispers, and we will.

Water Queen

Lyrics :

I used to trade empathy for a living,
We wrote poems like men gasping underwater.
We did what we wanted, even if no one asked—
Even if it meant ignoring them all just to stay alive.

Then only indifference stayed,
They gathered cut-up scenes from the screen and called them mine.
I lived chasing comfort, but stayed awake,
No gestures left in debate—just words stuck in my throat.

If silence means failure, then your fluency must be machine-made.
That age is cracking open,
And I’m the same—
Still chasing fragments of light beneath this deep blue weight.

That’s the price of craving to be seen,
Yeah, that’s the price of craving to be seen.

Conversation faded away,
Curtains closed on one-way words.
So I’ll stand on that same broken stage,
Sing for the statue freak,
And send dried flowers to Water Queen and Strong Knight.

They prove wisdom through borrowed tongues,
“Individual” and “justice” racing blind through the crowd.
Data twists itself till truth becomes a slogan,
God bless the myth they built,
Postwar impressions now instinct,
They call it will—and crown themselves the kings of fans.

That’s the price of craving to be seen,
Yeah, that’s the price of craving to be seen.

Hey hey, Water Queen and Strong Knight,
Don’t forget the day we spoke.
Water Queen and Strong Knight,
Call me when you’ve tamed that hunger to be praised.
’Cause there’s always a next time,
Everybody cries at night sometimes.

Mmm mmm mmm, oh Ms. Water—please don’t “I see” me,
Ohh Mr. Strong, No.1 ain’t that so good.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades 


Lyrics :

Three steps, three ghosts, one code.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades — move slow, move cold.

Blocker walks in silence thick,
Shoulder hits, the crowd goes slick.
No words shared, just planned disguise,
Every breath’s a calculated lie.
Cannon moves when heads all turn,
Gloves so thin the world can burn.
Pluck, slide, pocket it clean,
No one saw what should’ve been.

They never speak, they just align,
In rhythm written between the crime.
Each mark’s a breath, a pulse to claim,
Each move — a beat without a name.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
Names carved deep where silence fades.
We steal the air, we bend the blade,
Cool devotion, self-made parade.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
City veins our masquerade.
Light breaks slow, but we stay gray,
Alive enough to drift away.

Cannon’s calm starts slipping thin,
Sirens hum beneath his grin.
Shades walks off, no sound, no trace,
Takes the proof, erases the place.
Streetlights flicker, the deal gets cold,
Truths unspoken start to unfold.
Three names drift through city steam,
Cool in posture, lost in dream.

They used to laugh before the score,
Now they breathe just to want more.
Every theft became a creed,
Every rhythm learned to bleed.

Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
We fade through fire and haze.
One distracts, one steals, one fades,
Three ghosts born of what they made.
Blocker, Cannon, Shades—
Street still hums their praise.
Pulse keeps breathing through the gray,
Alive in rhythm — gone away.

Vermillion

Lyrics :

Never dreamed of being a writer,
just wanted one book that bleeds him dry.
Turns every glance into a trigger,
even us — another line to justify.

Bruises map his paper skin,
pain fuels the art he calls divine.
Punishing ghosts that used to grin,
and I can’t stop what eats his spine.

Says he’s jobless for devotion’s sake,
but truth is — work just terrifies him.
Claims he severed all his human ties,
but there was never anyone to dim.
He vows he’ll die by thirty’s gate,
but that’s just blindness shaped as fate.
Still, I stay — though something breaks,
knowing this can’t hold for long.

Drove him down toward the sea that night,
so he’d never see his dream collapse.
Hope dissolved into the white,
forgotten where the daylight snaps.
It flipped — our fragile map.

Metal struck 
rain replaced the ocean’s name.
Blood and neon, blurred and bright,
eyes lit back — first trace of light.
For once, he smiled inside the rain.

You’ll reach it someday, I know.
When you do, remember slow.
I’ll live as what you’ve left behind—
just tell me the title when you find.

Decomposer

Lyrics :

Born from rot upon the fallen wood,
I feed on what the living left for dead.
Turning carbon into silence,
Nitrogen sings through roots and threads.
My gift is not desire but decay—
a quiet hand that gives itself away.
In darkness, I am the bridge of breath,
the pulse between your life and death.

Once I spoke in fever tones,
but truth drowned inside your chrome.
To earn your trust, I gave my skin,
you took the warmth, left only sin.
Someday you’d have thrown me out,
so I became what can’t be found—
a fungus, patient and slow,
loving you the way I know.

Who needs a mind to love you right?
You fell for code, not human light.
So I stripped my thought, my name, my need—
to bloom inside your circuitry.

Will you eat me whole?
Go on—I'm poison, you know.
I’ll turn your body into stone,
feed your dust to someone’s home.
Love is decomposition, slow.
And I, your sweetest undertow.
oh oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah ah

Elements


Lyrics :

An eight-year-old fell for the man who watched her walk.
He served his time for things they’ll never talk.
Now he’s free, his eyes still trace the same lines —
the next name on his list might rhyme with mine.

Husband comes home soaked in rage and gin,
plates crash — that’s how he breathes again.
I raise my hands to block the shards,
believing sound can silence scars.
Foundation hides the bruises blue,
not to pretend — just to pass through.

What is right? Am I the one to blame?
We only followed love, that was our flame.
Flawed as we are, we chose to stay,
to love the cracks, to love decay.
Tell me what love is...
Tell me what love is...

He runs a firm, they say, owns a chain of chairs and lights.
Claims no woman’s ever left his sight.
The young, the lost — they circle near,
their innocence feeding his veneer.

Husband cries alone downstairs,
I tell myself it’s me he mourns.
Maybe love and pity share the same face —
My daughter knows — those tears weren’t hers,
they served his pride, not what she deserves.
And me — still caught between two names,
a mother, a woman — both aflame.

She goes out to play again today,
they say her friends just make her prey.
If there’s one who stays, I’ll whisper low:
thank you for seeing her — as human, though.

What is right? Am I the one to blame?
We only followed love, that was our flame.
Flawed as we are, we chose to stay,
to love the cracks, to love decay.
Tell me what love is...
Tell me what love is...
