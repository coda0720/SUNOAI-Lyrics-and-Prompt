[drum prompt only]
The drums move like a living creature—sluggish yet sentient—adding ghost hits and tom rolls that expand in the second bar, creating the sense of an animal twitching beneath the surface,
drummer plays with jazz-like freedom and authority: bursts of speed, dynamic accents, fluid cymbal work, and long expressive solos that begin restrained and then erupt into frantic, aggressive flurries. Ghost strokes and tom-swells pulse beneath the beat, giving the groove an unstable, organic tension.


[heart shaped box prompt]
offbeat. A slow-burning grunge track, built on dissonant tension and understated chaos, Use a raw chord progression like F5 - Ab5 - D5 - B5, avoiding resolution to keep the mood unstable, Guitars should be overdriven but not saturated—dry, gritty tones with subtle feedback, Drums emphasize syncopated backbeats with minimal fills, enhancing the sense of dragging unease, The melody should drift over the chords with a loose, almost detached phrasing, Lead vocals are raspy, often slurred, with sudden dynamic shifts—gritty whispers turning into strained cries, Add demonic backing vocals in key sections: deep, layered growls or warped harmonies shadowing the main vocal lines, as if echoing from another room, Keep the tempo steady but lethargic, with moments of near collapse, Let silence between chords create space for discomfort, A track that resists climax, lingering in a state of beautiful decay and emotional corrosion
offbeat grunge track built on dissonant guitar riffs and animal-like rhythmic tension. The drums move like a living creature—sluggish yet sentient—adding ghost hits and tom rolls that expand in the second bar, creating the sense of an animal twitching beneath the surface. Guitars are gritty and detuned, playing jagged, unresolved chords that scrape against each other to heighten unease. Bass lines move slightly behind the beat, thick and breathing, anchoring the chaos with a hypnotic pulse. Tempo drags intentionally, hovering around 78–82 BPM, emphasizing groove through syncopation and micro-delays. The mix should feel raw and tactile—snare hits dull and dusty, cymbals dry and restrained, leaving air between phrases. Moments of silence punctuate the track, letting distortion and feedback breathe as if exhaling tension.
A slow-burning groove that feels unstable, predatory, and alive—an offbeat embodiment of grunge dissonance.

[53-TET grunge prompt]
Dual-channel microtonal grunge guitars: left channel tuned −20 cents, right channel +20 cents.
Play power chords (E5–G5–A5) with thick distortion and wide stereo spread.

世界各地に暗に存在していると噂される超能力者たちの崩壊。均衡を保つための存在で基本社会とは不可侵だが、痕跡を残さない方法で”強制共振による振動で血流操作””周波数操作による究極的な鬱病付与”などを用いて国に仕える。
物語は超能力者による超能力者狩り。

歌詞：







Seductive female vocal, breathy and intimate — tempting whispers and sensual sighs between lyrics to create vocal-driven groove and tension.
crushing industrial stomp beat with distorted low-end and mechanical pulse
Drums slam like a breathing creature — loose, off-beat, heavy ghost hits, deep toms, and dragging snare accents.
Syncopated low-end pulse, warped synth stabs, subtle pitch-mod noise, and mechanical breathing atmospheres.
